Title: Default Image Loading in Email Clients
Date: 2015-01-24 17:49

A quick post, just to ask the question: did email clients like iOS/OSX Mail and GMail change to displaying images by default (as opposed to blocking them) simply to make open stats in email list tools like Mailchimp more impressive than their competition?

If I'm not mistaken, Apple was the first major player to make this move. (Correct me if I'm wrong!)

If true, it's a clever way to manipulate businesses to shift marketing resources to focus more on the Apple crowd.

If false, they did it to provide a better user experience, I surmise. That, and this post was a waste of time. Well, at least it was short.
