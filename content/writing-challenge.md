Title: Writing Habit Challenge
Date: 2014-09-26 21:00

Writing is hard. Writing well is harder.

I’ve tried blogging before, but didn’t develop the necessary habit. I know that writing will help me learn as well as teach others. What better reasons are there?

I’m using [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) as my blog post planning and drafting tool. It works well as a single contributor tool - and seeing how [jamesaddison.ca](http://jamesaddison.ca) will only ever be my writing, it suits me fine.

This blog runs on [Python-based software called Pelican](http://getpelican.com) and is currently hosted on [Github](https://github.com/). This setup is not for the non-techie. The design is intentionally kept simple in an effort to keep focus on the content. Perhaps this will encourage me to publish quality posts!

So, with this post and this new site, I’m challenging myself to write every day. They won’t always be published posts, but snippets at the very least. I’m planning to keep this blog focused on startups and related topics.

I’m optimistic: let’s see where it goes from here.
